LIVE WEBCAM FEED TO ASCII TEXT CONVERTER 
THIS PROJECT USES LIBRARIES CV AND PILLOW 
I HAD REAL FUN MAKING THIS PROJECT AND WORKING WITH THE PILLOW LIBRARY FOR THE FIRST TIME.

the code is not completely my own, i have used youtube tutorials to learn concepts and syntaxes and basic working of the project 
also snooped around reddit and geeksforgeeks for deeper understanding

I WOULD LIKE TO SCALE THIS PROJECT FURTHER INTO A WEBPAGE OR AN APP

THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR VISITING THIS PROJECT AND TAKING TIME TO READ THI README.MD!!!!
